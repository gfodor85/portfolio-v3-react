              Hello,<br />
                Iâ€™m an enthusiastic front-end developer and designer with many years of experience
                in building and designing clean and fast websites. I am always opened to new ideas
                and new ways which help me to develop my skills and try to become better and
                better. In my adventure of development I always learn new methods and technologies
                which result in cool websites. I have experience in creating a wide range of web
                projects such as landing pages, eCommerce or WordPress sites that will work and
                look great across all devices.
